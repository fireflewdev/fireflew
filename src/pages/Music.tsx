                    Something cool that I did was create an adaptive music engineâ€“in other words, the game's music is influenced by your actions.

Second, a patron-facing web-app that allows users to request a song (potentially for a fee). My job as the front-end developer was to code up these interfaces and make sure they're intuitive to our clients.

                    {"\n\n"} Business-wise, things have been great!

                    In a world ruled by DAWs, the easiest way to lay out a melody or rhythm is to plot notes on a grid. While this method is quick, you're out of luck if you try to emulate a real instrument's performance unless you buy hardware to actually record into your DAW (Digital Audio Workstationâ€“think Ableton, Logic, FL Studio, etc.)
                    {"\n\n"}Now with VR, we're able to interact with objects in a very organic fashionâ€“we can whack things, drag things, and pick things up in ways that are natural to human movement. The goal of my project is to harness this "human error" to record notes and change parameters in your favorite DAW. <i>Put simply, I want to make a VR MIDI Controller!</i>

By assigning each part of the drum (kick, snare, hats, etc.) to different Velowhackables, you can "air drum" out how the velocity of each part evolves in the sequence. Normally you'd have to assign a velocity to each note in an entire drum sequence (which could take forever and might not sound as natural)

In the intro, a cacophony of intersecting electric guitar notes interrupts a gliding synth arpeggio. Throughout the song, the dissonant guitar and synth reappear in gliding patterns that don't subscribe to the harmony of the music in the traditional sense, but help create an ebb and flow of energy & evoke a slight unsettling feeling akin to being in a bad dream.

                                The art of working with other creatives is maintaining the delicate balance between knowing when to assert your ideas and when to sit back and listen. As someone who usually produces on my own, this was a great opportunity to practice that skill, and I truly believe we were able to bring out the best in each other!`,

                                subtitle: "Electronica piece in 7/8 that experiments with various production & composition techniques",
                                description: `My goal starting this project was to write a song in 7/8 that felt like it still flowed well rhythmically. The pluck playing throughout most of the song is actually the combination of 2 polymetric sequences (4/4 and 5/4) split between the left and right channels. The synth texture in the beginning was created in a similar manner but with more sequences, panned differently, each delayed slightly at differing amounts to create a chaotic, overwhelming sound. I can then fade this texture in and out to manage tension.
                                
                                To create the snare effect at (1:41), I sent my drum's snare to a separate aux channel, in which I added a very short reverb with 100% wetness, a delay, and a flanger. I can then automate the volume of this track to control this effect, which served well as a transition.
                                
                                Personally, I really enjoy the synth solo starting at (2:55). ðŸ˜Š During the solo, the song modulates from Em to Cm. During the transition time (3:16) I also switch the time briefly to 6/8, which shortens the phrases by a beat, creating a feeling that the song is "skipping over" itself, which both adds energy and signals the listener a big change is happening.
                                
                                As a final note, to create the rising effect at (3:49), I took a sample of one of my screams and ran it through Waves's H-Delay with a feedback of slightly over 100%. This means that during each repetiton of the delayed audio, the volume will increase slightly. While this is happening, I slowly automate the delay of the reverb slightly down, which not only decreases the time between each repetition, but it also increases the pitch as well. A sound that gets louder, faster, and higher over time seems a riser to me!
                                `,

                                description: `The foundational element of this piece is the bitcrushed, chimey sound that plays constantly (created by layering an organ and a few mbirasâ€“all Logic stock samples). This sound constantly evolves with the help of Logic's Ringshifter, which is, for our intents, a Ring modulator (modulates amplitude).
                                
                                The result sounds very metallic and almost scratchy. Notice how this sound can range from almost being background noise (0:44) to a device used for emphasis (1:18), to providing overwhelming energyâ€“notice the transition at (1:00). Having one underlying sound guide the listener through the piece keeps a sense of familiarity and thus leaves more room for you to try weird things ðŸ˜Š

                                A few other small notes: it was very fun chopping up and using Apple's text-to-speech in creative work. And like my other electronica piece here, I experimented a bit with less conventional time signatures; this one's in 5/4!

                                description: `Convolution reverb normally aims to emulate real spaces by using an impulse response (a "click" sound reverberating in a space). When audio sample plays through this effect, it basically plays the impulse response, but filtered so that the frequencies that play match the frequencies of the original signal. The end result sounds like the original sound but played in the room the impulse response was gathered from.
                                
                                The catch is, impulse responses are just audio filesâ€“they can be of anything! For this song, I set an entire 3-minute long instrumental piece to be the impulse response. When playing a few short notes at varying times from a synthesizer into this reverb, the processed frequencies mix really nicely together to form ambient-like music.`,
